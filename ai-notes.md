# AI Progress Notes - December 9, 2025

## Project Overview
First Hackathon Project - A development project initialized with Spec-Driven Development (SDD) framework and Claude Code integration.

## Recent Progress

### Initial Setup (Commits)
1. **Initial commit: first project files** (a718301)
   - Set up Spec-Driven Development framework with `.specify/` directory
   - Added comprehensive templates for ADRs, PHRs, specifications, plans, and tasks
   - Configured Claude Code slash commands in `.claude/commands/` directory
   - Created project constitution and agent guidelines in `CLAUDE.md`
   - Initialized README.md for the project

2. **Add test file for Claude auto-commit verification** (5648410)
   - Created `test.js` with basic "Hello Claude!" test content
   - Added `test-claude.txt` for verification testing

### Project Structure Established
- **`.specify/`** - SDD framework with templates and bash scripts for:
  - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
  - Prompt History Records (PHRs)
  - Feature specifications, plans, and tasks
  - Agent context management

- **`.claude/commands/`** - Slash commands for development workflow:
  - `/sp.specify` - Feature specification creation
  - `/sp.plan` - Implementation planning
  - `/sp.tasks` - Task generation
  - `/sp.implement` - Execution
  - `/sp.git.commit_pr` - Git workflow automation
  - And additional commands for ADRs, analysis, checklists, etc.

### Key Components
- **Constitution** (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) - Project principles and standards
- **CLAUDE.md** - Comprehensive agent operating instructions following SDD methodology
- **Test Files** - Basic test setup for Claude integration verification

## Current Status
- Repository is clean with all changes committed
- Main branch is up to date
- Development framework fully configured and ready for feature development
- Ready to begin implementing hackathon features using the SDD workflow

## Next Steps (Potential)
- Define first feature specification using `/sp.specify`
- Create implementation plan using `/sp.plan`
- Generate actionable tasks using `/sp.tasks`
- Begin implementation with `/sp.implement`
